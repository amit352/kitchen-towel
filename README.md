### Deployment

To start with this project, firstly we build the frame of the every page with bootstrap. The main funcition of each page are below:

* homepage.html: search a room under some criterics for tenants.

* index.html: sign in for tenants.

* signup.html: sign up for tenants.

* addroom.html: add rooms for landlords.

* detail.html: show the detailed information of a room for tenants.

The css img and js files are the corresponding contents improve the funciton of each pages.
